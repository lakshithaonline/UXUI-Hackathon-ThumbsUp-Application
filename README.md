# FOSS Community UX/UI Hackathon

This is a description of our successful participation in the FOSS Community UX/UI hackathon, organized by NSBM Green University. It was a competition where participants were given a scenario and had to design a mobile application using specific web applications such as Figma, Photoshop, Sketch, Adobe XD, and Adobe Illustrator.

Our team selected Figma and completed the project within a day, successfully meeting the requirements of the scenario. You can check out our mobile app design here:
